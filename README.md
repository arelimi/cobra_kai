# Cobra Kai

This is a repo for trying to play around and learn a bit about network statistics.  At Peter's recommendation, I'm learning off of a small dataset called the Zachary Karate Club.

The end goal would be to implement some of the existing algorithms in Ruby (and maybe Python and Elixir), as well as just understand what the heck is going on.
